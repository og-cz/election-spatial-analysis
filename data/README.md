# OpenHalalan: The Philippine National and Local Election Dataset Project

**OpenHalalan** is an open data initiative to make national and local election results in the Philippines freely accessible for researchers, journalists, policymakers, and the public.

## About the Project
This repository contains a curated, reproducible dataset of Philippine election results from national and local races. Our goal is to foster transparency, reproducibility, and wider participation in election research.

Everything rebuilds from the committed raw scrapes with one command, and a completeness audit ships alongside the data — including an honest account of what is missing. See [How to Cite](#how-to-cite).

## Dataset Contents

Two datasets, each independently usable and independently citable.

**1. Election Winners** — `data/output/NLE_Winners_2004-2025.csv`
One row per *winning* candidate per office, across eight cycles (2004, 2007, 2010, 2013,
2016, 2019, 2022, 2025). Covers the seven local and district offices: Governor, Vice
Governor, Provincial Board Member, Member of the House of Representatives, Mayor, Vice
Mayor, Councilor. **It contains no nationwide races** — no President, Vice President,
Senator or Party List.

**2. Vote Counts** — `data/output/NLE_Vote_Counts_2007-2025.csv.gz`
Every candidate's votes, winners and losers alike, per city and municipality. Seven cycles:
**2007, 2010, 2013, 2016, 2019, 2022 and 2025**. 2007 (Wikipedia, executive races only), 2010
(COMELEC archive + Ianmaps + Wikipedia) and 2013 (Rappler) are partial — see the data
dictionary. The 2010–2025 cycles include the nationwide races.

Full column definitions, coverage and known gaps:
[winners](data/output/DATA_DICTIONARY_WINNERS.md) · [vote counts](data/output/DATA_DICTIONARY_VOTE_COUNTS.md)

> **Status.** A completeness audit runs with `python data/audit/make.py` and writes
> `data/audit/issues.csv`. Four serious defects have been fixed in this build — winners
> were being selected alphabetically rather than by votes in 2022; the City of Manila was
> missing from 2022; Samar's 2025 results were Eastern Samar's, duplicated; and place names
> changed spelling between cycles. The remaining flagged issues are gaps inherited from the
> 2004–2019 source file. **The published Zenodo record predates these fixes.**

## How to Use
- Read the data dictionary for the dataset you need (linked above) — the known gaps matter.
- Download the CSVs from `data/processed/` (winners) or `data/raw_data/` (vote counts).
- Researchers and developers are welcome to use, analyze, or build upon the dataset.

## Reproducing the datasets

Everything is rebuilt from the committed raw COMELEC scrapes with one command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run_all.py
```

| | |
|---|---|
| `python run_all.py` | Rebuild both datasets from the raw scrapes, then audit. |
| `python run_all.py --audit-only` | Just re-run the completeness audit. |
| `python run_all.py --scrape` | Re-scrape COMELEC first. **Slow** (hours, drives a real browser). Not needed — the raw scrapes are committed. |

The pipeline lives in `data/make.py` (one entry point, three stages):

```
data/scraping   COMELEC websites -> data/raw_data/{2022,2025}/    [skipped by default]
data/compiling  raw scrapes + data/source/ -> data/output/
data/audit      both datasets -> data/audit/{issues,coverage_*}.csv
```

Run a single stage with `python data/make.py --stage compiling`.

All paths and settings live in [`config.yaml`](config.yaml); no script hardcodes a path.
Superseded and one-off scripts are kept in `archive/` and are not part of the pipeline.

## How to Cite

Both datasets are released as **one citable bundle under a single DOI**. They are not
independent: the 2016, 2019, 2022 and 2025 winners are *derived* from the vote counts, so citing
the winners without the ballots that justify them would obscure their provenance.

Machine-readable metadata lives in [`CITATION.cff`](CITATION.cff).

> **Cite the concept DOI, not a version DOI.**
> [10.5281/zenodo.17783099](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17783099) always resolves to the
> newest version of the dataset. Every version-specific DOI is a snapshot, and snapshots go
> stale: v3 remained the cited record for months after we knew its 2022 data was wrong. If
> you need a fixed snapshot for exact reproducibility, take the version DOI from the record
> page and say which version you used.

> **Earlier records contain known defects and should not be cited.** Everything before v4
> carries a truncated 2022: 7 of the 10 presidential candidates, no party-list race at all,
> 57 wrong councilor winners, and no City of Manila. v4 re-scrapes 2022 from COMELEC's JSON
> API and fixes all of it.
